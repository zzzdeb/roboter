# Hello World example

This example simply blinks all of the LEDs on the dev board and outputs a counter via serial.
Note that some dev boards do not have a serial output by default, and therefore do output anything.

This example is compatible with these development boards:

- `arduino_uno`
- `nucleo_f103rb`
- `stm32f072_discovery` (no serial)
- `stm32f1_discovery` (no serial)
- `stm32f3_discovery` (no serial)
- `stm32f4_discovery` (no serial)
- `stm32f429_discovery`
- `stm32f469_discovery`
- `stm32f7_discovery`
